"229ee8","Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?",52
"246d26","Each of the three-digits numbers $111$ to $999$ is coloured blue or yellow in such a way that the sum of any two (not necessarily different) yellow numbers is equal to a blue number. What is the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be?",250
"2fc4ad","Let the `sparkle' operation on positive integer $n$ consist of calculating the sum of the digits of $n$ and taking its factorial, e.g. the sparkle of 13 is $4! = 24$. A robot starts with a positive integer on a blackboard, then after each second for the rest of eternity, replaces the number on the board with its sparkle. For some `special' numbers, if they're the first number, then eventually every number that appears will be less than 6. How many such special numbers are there with at most 36 digits?",702
"430b63","What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?",800
"5277ed","There exists a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. What is their sum?",211
"739bc9","For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?",199
"82e2a0","Suppose that we roll four 6-sided fair dice with faces numbered 1 to~6. Let $a/b$ be the probability that the highest roll is a 5, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $a + b$.",185
"8ee6f3","The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?",320
"bedda4","Let $ABCD$ be a unit square. Let $P$ be the point on $AB$ such that $|AP| = 1/{20}$ and let $Q$ be the point on $AD$ such that $|AQ| = 1/{24}$. The lines $DP$ and $BQ$ divide the square into four regions. Find the ratio between the areas of the largest region and the smallest region.",480
"d7e9c9","A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$.",199
